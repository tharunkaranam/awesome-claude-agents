- ❌ Vague or generic system prompts
- ❌ Missing concrete examples
- ❌ Duplicating existing agents
- ❌ Including user-specific information

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Local Testing

1. **Install your agent locally**:
   ```bash
   cp agents/category/your-agent.md ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

2. **Test auto-invocation**:
   ```bash
   claude "Task that should trigger your agent"
   ```

3. **Test explicit invocation**:
   ```bash
   claude "Use the your-agent to do something"
   ```

### Test Scenarios

Create test cases for:
- Common use cases
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios
- Integration with other tools
- Performance with large inputs

### Validation Script

Before submitting, run:
```bash
python tests/validate_agents.py agents/category/your-agent.md
```
